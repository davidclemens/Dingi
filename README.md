Dingi is a MATLAB toolbox collection for data processing of marine research gear deployed by GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel, Germany.

*As a dingi to a marine research vessel, this toolbox shall be the assistant to the researcher.*

:warning: :construction: â€”
This repository, especially the documentation is work in progress and testing and therefore reliability is in its infancy.

## Installation

### Dependencies

The Dingi toolbox is written for MATLAB and is developed and tested with `MATLAB R2017b`.

Some functions depend on the [Gibbs Seawater (GSW) Oceanographic Toolbox](https://www.teos-10.org/software.htm#1) for MATLAB.

### Setup

1. Download the latest release (0.1.0b1) [here](https://github.com/davidclemens/Dingi/archive/refs/heads/release.zip).
2. Unzip the archive.
3. Rename the unzipped folder from `Dingi-release` to `Dingi` and move it to your desired location `<DingiFolder>`.
4. Add that location to your MATLAB search path by running `run <DingiFolder>/setupMATLABPath.m` in the MATLAB command line.
